## Data Analysis Process

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
- Performed data transformations to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated the distribution of key variables such as age, income, loan amount, and credit score.
- Visualized relationships between features like credit score, loan amount, and approval rate.

### Statistical Analysis
- Analyzed trends in loan approvals across various demographics.
- Identified key factors that influence loan approval such as income, credit score, and employment status.

### Key Findings
- Higher credit scores and stable employment significantly increase loan approval chances.
- Applicants with bankruptcy history or high debt-to-income ratios are more likely to be denied.
- Insights suggest potential improvements in the loan application process to reduce default risks.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides critical insights into factors affecting loan approval rates. By understanding these trends, lenders can refine their risk models and optimize the loan approval process.
